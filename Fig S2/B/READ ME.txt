% Below are the necessary steps to generate Figure S2B


% Reproduce from already generated data (Not possible-data package was too heavy to upload in GitHub, files will be provided upon request)

01 Go to folder '03 Fit simultaneously_threshold' (there are 4 folders inside with probabilities data calculated based on different thresholds).
02 Run 'Estimate_rates_kon_vary' to generate figure S2B.



% Reproduce figure from newly generated data 

01 From Figure 3 folder go to 'Activation folder' and 'Deactivation folder' and run stochastic simulations.
02 Save the generated files 'Activation_04', 'Deactivation_04', 'Constant_Activation_04', 'Constant_Deactivation_04'.
03 In this directory, go to 01 Activation folder. Save the files 'Activation_04' and 'Constant_Activation_04'. 
04 Run the script 'Threshold loop'. This scripts generates the activation probabilities for 100 random sampled threshold.
05 After running 'Threshold loop', 100 new files will be saved in the directory.
06 Transfer those files to the '03 Fit simultaneously_threshold' folder 'Data_activation_C' and 'Data_activation_O'
07 Repeat steps 03-06 in the '02 Deactivation folder'
08 Run 'Estimate_rates_kon_vary' to generate figure S2B
