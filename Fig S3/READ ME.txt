% NOTE: This folder is the same as Figure 3 folder. The only difference in that the stochastic model includes the extra
reactions on table S6. To generate figure S3 the instructions are the same as in Figure 3:


01 Activation folder: Runs 500 stochastic simulations. Each simulation starts in an 'OFF state' generated stochastically. 
02 Deactivation folder: Runs 500 stochastic simulations. Each simulation starts in an 'ON state' generated stochastically. 
03 Fit simultaneously: Fits theoretical probability equations to the stochastic simulation results;

To reproduce Figure S3 follow the steps bellow:

In Activation folder:
---01 Run script 'Run_several_cells_02'
---02 Results will be saved in files 'Constant_Activation_04' and 'Activation_04'
---03 Next, save those results in 'results folder'. 
---04 In 'results folder' run 'Calculate_Probabilities_02' 
---05 Results will be saved in files 'DATA_C_ACTIVATION' and 'DATA_O_ACTIVATION' 

In Deactivation folder:

---01 Run script 'Run_several_cells_02'
---02 Results will be saved in files 'Constant_Deactivation_04' and 'Deactivation_04'
---03 Next, save those results in 'results folder'. 
---04 In 'results folder' run 'Calculate_Probabilities_04' 
---05 Results will be saved in files 'DATA_C_DEACTIVATION' and 'DATA_O_DEACTIVATION' 

In Fit simultaneously folder:

---01 Copy files 'DATA_C_ACTIVATION', 'DATA_O_ACTIVATION','DATA_C_DEACTIVATION' and 'DATA_O_DEACTIVATION' to folder 'Fit simultaneously' and run 'Fit_simultaneouly_01_C_V2' script. Final figure is produced.
